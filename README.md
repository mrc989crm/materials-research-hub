Microstructures play a key role to understand mechanical properties of a material with respect to its processing history. Deep learning allows us to decrypt hierarchical microstructures for a better understanding and description of advanced engineering materials. By sharing our projects and allowing interdisciplenary contributions, we envision to give the development of new materials a significant boost.
